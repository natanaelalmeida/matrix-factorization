**Matrix factorization is a mathematical technique widely used in recommender systems, especially collaborative filtering, to predict users' preferences based on their interactions with items. This approach is crucial for streaming platforms, e-commerce and social networks, as it allows for personalized recommendations.**

The main idea is to "split" an interaction matrix $R$, with dimensions $[m, n]$, into two smaller matrices that represent latent characteristics of users and items:

$$\huge
R \approx U \cdot V^T
$$

1. $m$ is the number of users.
2. $n$ is the number of items.
3. The matrix $U (of \ dimensions \ [m,k])\ $ represents users in a latent feature space.
4. The matrix $V (of \ dimensions \ [n,k])\ $ represents items in a latent feature space.

The value $k$ defines the number of latent factors, which capture implicit patterns in interactions between users and items.

## Example

Imagine a futuristic scenario, at a party illuminated by soft neon lights and nice ambient sound in the background. Robbie, a curious and music-loving robot, finds himself at the center of a rather peculiar chatting circle. Around him, four iconic figures discuss their favorite music styles: Ripley, Darth Vader, Spock and Hermione. Robbie adjusts...
